It looks like the link you provided is incomplete. The GitHub Readme Stats API requires additional parameters to display data. 

If you want to display your GitHub statistics on a README file, you can use the following format:

```

![Your Name's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=yourusername&show_icons=true&theme=yourtheme)

```

Replace "yourusername" with your GitHub username and "yourtheme" with the theme you want to use (e.g. dark, light, gruvbox, etc.). You can also customize the display of your stats by adding additional parameters such as "include_all_commits" and "count_private".

For example, to display your GitHub stats with the Gruvbox theme and including all commits, you can use the following code:

```

![Your Name's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=Mario&show_icons=true&include_all_commits=true&theme=gruvbox)

```

I hope this helps!
